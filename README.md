This conducted research study entitled “Artemis Portal: An Automated Real-Time
Tardiness Monitoring System Using Laravel Framework for Streamlined Attendance” is a
mandatory component for Grade 12 students under Electronic Information, Communication, and
Technology (EICT), Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) in their
research course: RESE: Inquiries, Investigation, and Immersion. This exploration, through a
rigorous quantitative analysis, aims to allow the researchers to develop a web application that
can provide an efficient alternative and solution for the recurring problem that the tardiness
monitoring system poses at Colegio San Agustin - Bacolod.
This research aims to combat the said problem by developing a web application that can
create and organize a repository of tardiness records of students and monitor, allow, or decline
their requests for late slip permits through an administrative dashboard that can be accessed by
school moderators.
